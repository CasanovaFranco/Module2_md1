[Hello word](https://www.youtube.com)

```

  When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.
  
Here are some example R commands:
```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
